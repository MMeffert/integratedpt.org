We determine and treat the root cause of the injury or pain. Our focus is to normalize a dysfunction with soft tissue, joint and myofascial techniques to regain movement.  This creates a good foundation for pain reduction and improved motion.  Then we can build the body back, with neuro re-education to begin training muscular balance and movement patterns.  We continue adding building blocks with stabilization of core, proper function in extremities, and reducing stresses and pain. IPT therapists are specialized in advanced orthopedic, sports medicine, spine, and manual therapy, with an average of over 20 years of expertise. Our locations are convenient, accessible, and scheduling is prompt with one of our skilled physical therapists.<br>
